    <p>Jenin is a city in the State of Palestine in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
        The city serves as the administrative center of the Jenin Governorate of Palestine and is a major center for the surrounding towns.
        [2] Jenin came under Israeli occupation in 1967 and was put under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank in 1993.
        In 2017, Jenin had a population of approximately 50,000 people, whilst the Jenin refugee camp had a population of about 10,000, housing Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Palestine War.
        [1][3] The camp has since become a stronghold of Palestinian militants against British colonialism and Israeli occupation, being the location of several incidents relating to the Israeli Palestinian conflict.
